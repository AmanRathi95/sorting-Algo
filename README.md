Sorting Visualization Algorithm: This Python script animates the process of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort. By using libraries such as matplotlib or pygame, it visually represents the step-by-step transformations of the array elements, allowing users to see how elements are compared and swapped in real-time. The algorithm helps in understanding sorting dynamics through visual feedback, making complex sorting processes more intuitive and engaging.
